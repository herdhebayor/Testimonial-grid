          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subject i learned
          were current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly
          feel i got every penny's worth.

          "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make able
          transition and heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for 
          the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
          12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -time of my life. Since completing the course
          , I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves, Getting guidance from them and

          "Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I need some structure from 
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encourage to enroll by a former 
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It t0ok my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
          could ever have. In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.  "
